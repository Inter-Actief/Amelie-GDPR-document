(Far) before the AVG went into effect Inter-*Actief* stored all personal details that are used by committees. These personal details are (digitally) present on the committee drives of the corresponding committees. These documents were created before the AVG came into effect and are only used as reference documents. Because of the legality principle it is allowed to keep these documents unchanged. Next to that, it is a huge amount of work to anonymize all of these documents, so Inter-*Actief* will keep these documents as they are. Examples of this are secretarial yearly reports, documents for study trips and old almanacs.

These mistakes might be caused by becoming out-of-date or by mistakes in the database. To guarantee correctness of the personal details of all members, and to facilitate the right to rectification, this yearly procedure is desired.
