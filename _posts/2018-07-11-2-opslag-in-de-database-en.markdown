#### 2.4.2 Committees and Functions
*Legal Ground a, explicit permission when joining committee*  
Active members are a member of one or more committees within Inter-*Actief* in which functions are assigned to members. Seeing that a number of these functions correspond with a certain responsibility with regard to other members of the association, it is of importance that these are registered in the active members administration. The member grants permission for the processing of these details when they join a committee in accordance with paragraph [3.2](#32-board-and-committee-work). The committees and functions of a member are also saved if the membership of the member ends.

Next to the physical signed authorization in the binder, Inter-*Actief* saves a reference to this authorization digitally. The starting date and possibly the end date of the authorization is also saved. Amendments (changes to the authorizations) are also saved. These are corrections to an authorization (like a change in bank account number or correction of a name). These are saved because amendments need to be sent to the bank with the next debt collection. Authorizations and amendments are saved for up to 14 months after the last use, or after the termination of the membership, for the self-interest of the association. This is because objections to debt collections can be made up to 14 months after the collection has taken place.

#### 2.5.3 Debt Collection(s), Debt Collection Instruction(s) and Reversals
*Legal Ground b, minimal execution debt collection agreement*  
To execute debt collections and keep track of our financial administration, Inter-*Actief* saves all debt collections, debt collection instruction(s) (entries in a debt collection), and reversals of transactions, in our database. These details are necessary for the correct financial settlement of our debt collection agreement. The executed debt collections, their instructions and the reversals are saved in our database for 7 years after execution, because this is required by the Dutch law[<sup>3</sup>](#references).
