### 1.3. Rights of the involved
Every European citizen has the following rights:

**Right of inspection** (GDPR[<sup>1</sup>](#references) Article 15)
> Everyone has the right to inspect the personal details that Inter-*Actief* processes about them. Next to that, every person whose personal details are processed by Inter-*Actief* has the right to inspect the following information:
> - the processing purposes of the processing activities performed on their personal details;
> - the categories of personal details that are involved in each processing;
> - the people who and/or organizations which might have access to the personal details;
> - the storage period of the personal details;
> - their rights concerning the processing of their personal details;
> - all available information about instances where Inter-*Actief* collects personal details about them where the personal details are not provided by the person directly;
> - (if applicable) useful information about the underlying logic of profiling performed by Inter-*Actief*, and the importance and consequences of this profiling for the member.

**Right of rectification** (GDPR Article 16)
> If Inter-*Actief* possesses incorrect or incomplete personal details about someone, this person has the right to let these details be corrected and/or completed as quickly as possible.

**Right to be forgotten** (GDPR Article 17)
> Everyone has the right to request Inter-*Actief* to delete all personal details concerning them. It is mandatory for Inter-*Actief* to comply to this request within reasonable time. Besides that, it is mandatory for Inter-*Actief* to remove personal details within a reasonable time in the following situations:
> - The personal details are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were initially collected and/or stored.
> - Someone revokes their given permission for the processing of the personal details. (The deletion is only mandatory if the processing of the personal details is solely based on this permission).
> - Someone successfully objects to the processing of their personal details (see "Right to objection").
> - The personal details were processed in an unlawful manner.
> - There is a law that obligates Inter-*Actief* to delete the personal details.

**Right to restriction of processing** (GDPR Article 18)
> Everyone has the right to restrict the processing activities in the situations listed below. 'Restriction of processing' means that the concerning personal details can be stored, but that permission from the person is necessary for all further processing of the details.
> - Somebody doubts the correctness of their personal details; the restriction applies as long as Inter-*Actief* needs to verify the correctness of these personal details and (if necessary) correct them.
> - Someone's personal details are processed unlawfully, but this person would rather restrict the processing instead of deleting the details.
> - Someone has objected to the processing of their personal details; the restriction applies until the objection is either marked as successful or is rejected.

**Right to transfer data** (GDPR Article 20)
> Everyone has the right to receive the personal details that they provided to Inter-*Actief* in the context of processing under legal basis *a* or *b* (see below), in a structured manner. This only applies if the processing activities occur (partly) automatically. They have the right to (without interference of Inter-*Actief*) transfer these details to others. If technically possible, Inter-*Actief* needs to transfer these details directly to the other party if requested by the person.
> NB: The right to be forgotten weighs heavier than the right to transfer data.

**Right to objection** (GDPR Article 21)
> Everyone has the right to, with arguments specific to them, object to the processing under legal basis *f* (see below). If this is the case Inter-*Actief* has to either stop the concerning processing for this person, or present arguments that outweigh the arguments of the person.
> Furthermore, everyone has the right to object against the processing of their personal details for direct marketing. If this is the case Inter-*Actief* may no longer use these personal details for direct marketing.

**Right to withdraw consent** (GDPR Article 7 lid 3)
> If someone has given consent to process their personal details, they have the right to withdraw this consent at all times. This withdrawal of the consent has no effect on processing that has occurred before the consent was withdrawn. Furthermore, the withdrawal of consent has to be as easy as giving the consent.

**Right of objection with AP** (AVG[<sup>2</sup>](#references) Chapter 2)
> Every person has the right to submit a complaint with the Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens), if they think that Inter-*Actief* is handling their personal details in an unjust manner.

### 1.4. Profiling at I.C.T.S.V. Inter-*Actief*
At Inter-*Actief* profiling happens sometimes while sending mailings. A company mailing for example is sometimes only sent to members that have been studying for an amount of years. Inter-*Actief* does this only to avoid their members getting flooded with mails that are not applicable to them.

### 1.5. Anonymous Statistics
Inter-*Actief* uses various statistics to steer its policy where necessary. For this, personal details could be used. In all cases the personal details are anonymized before display to guarantee the privacy of every person.

### 1.6. Access to personal details
Within Inter-*Actief* only the board and people appointed by the board have access to personal data. The people that have access to the personal details have signed a non-disclosure agreement with Inter-*Actief* for this purpose.

### 1.7. Explanation of Legal Grounds
The next chapters will give a full overview of all data processing activities of Inter-*Actief*. A (short) description will be given for each processing activity, as well as one (or more) legal grounds (*a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e* of *f*) on which the data processing activity is grounded. These legal grounds originate from the GDPR, Article 6[<sup>1</sup>](#references). Below follows a short overview of these legal grounds.

**a.** the person concerned has given permission for the processing of their personal details for one or more specific purposes;  
*It is allowed to process personal details if the person concerned has given permission for it. This legal ground is used by Inter-Actief to account for the processing if the other legal grounds do not apply.*

**b.** the processing is necessary for the execution of an agreement in which the person concerned is a party, or to take measures on request of the person concerned before the agreement is completed;  
*This legal ground means that Inter-Actief is allowed to process personal details if this is necessary for an agreement. This can for example be the membership agreement or the direct debit agreement.*

**c.** the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation of the processing party.  
*It is forbidden to break the law. Because of this Inter-Actief will process personal details if this is demanded by the law.*

**d.** the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the person concerned or of another natural person;  
*If the life of a member or other persons are at risk, it is allowed to process personal details for the benefit of help. This legal ground is not used by Inter-Actief.*

**e.** â€“  
*(This legal ground is meant for government agencies, therefore it can never be used by Inter-Actief.)*

**f.** the processing is necessary for the representation of legitimate interests of the processing party or of a third party, except for when the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned that relate to the protection of personal data, outweigh those interests, especially when the person concerned is a child.  
*This is the most complicated legal ground and also the legal ground that Inter-Actief uses the most to justify the processing. This legal ground means that Inter-Actief can process personal details if the interests of Inter-Actief outweigh the interest of the person concerned. If for example a member is not disadvantaged by the use of their student number, and Inter-Actief for example gets a large financial benefit from the use, then Inter-Actief is allowed to process the personal details. Inter-Actief has to stop the processing if the person concerned can demonstrate that the interests of the person outweigh those of Inter-Actief.*
